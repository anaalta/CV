## Ana Maria Suciu
Curious, highly motivated and driven by process and time-efficiency values, my career choice of becoming a developer rests on my research on digitalization. A problem-solver at heart, I am thriving on challenges and I love to share ideas and build on partnerships.
If I'd be a hash, my key - values would be {innovation: :smart cities, civic tech: :user generated data, digitalization: sharing economy}. 

My professional background is in the field of civic enagement, policy and advocacy. I honestly enjoyed my positions in non-profits, as I got to fulfill many roles, being at the same time researcher, data analyst, PR,  trainer and negotiator dealing with politicians and press. In my 8 years of experience, I started social businesses, trained community organizers, campaigned for social change. 

My dream developer job is within an agency or department working on innovating and digitalzing processes for clients, a place where we value impact, inclusiveness and sustainable growth.

## Skills

#### Project management
I developed my PM skills within non-profits, contributing to projects from inception and fundraising to final delivery. I am particulary fond of careful planning and spending and I think regular team meetings and constant monitoring and evaluation both internally and with stakeholders are key to successul delivery. As a PM, I lead teams of up to 10 people, I managed relationships with international donors and partners, I kept things within the budget and dealt with bureaucracy. 

#### Data analytics & reporting
My quantitative skills are in R, SPSS and STATA, with intermediate knowledge of Tableau for visualization.
Here's a sample of my quant research: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874861

#### Training and facilitating
I co-designed training courses and workshops to help build capacity for non-profits. Topics: project management, fundrasing, community organizing, EU funds accession. 

#### Networking
Working in networks of NGOs meant that I had to identify and recruit new members, maintain relations with the existing ones and constantly improve the services delivered to them, find new partnerships and alliances. Look at members as clients and you get a business skill out of it.   

#### Strategic Development
For both NACAB and ENNA, I identified industry trends and developed projects that moved the organizations forward. For example, within NACAB, I developed a new department based on trending methodollogies, I co-developed 7 community social businesses and got them funded.
