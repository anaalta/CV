My passion for code started with a data science project in R, some Code academy tutorials, some Code Wars katas, and culminated with a super-intensive bootcamp, Makers Academy! I am a fullstack software developer, trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming, with XP values at the core. 

Since July 2017, I work in Adtech, at Adventori, where we make software that personalizes advertising based on client data. While maintaining the MVC framework and an object-oriented mindset, this role thought me a lot, from new programming languages - Groovy, Java with the Grails framework - to the benefits of good extensive testing in the context of weekly deployment in production, to the advantages of decentralized databases(Cassandra) or RESTful search engines (Elasticsearch). 

## Skills

#### Programming
Ruby on Rails, Groovy/Grails, Java, Javascript, Scala, Spark

Testing: Spock, Capybara, Rspec, Jasmine

DB: Postgres, Cassandra, ElasticSearch

Version control: GitLab, GitHub

IDE: IntelliJ

#### Data analytics & reporting
This skill helped me deliver actionable research and document strategy. My quantitative tech skills are in R, R Studio, SPSS and STATA, with intermediate knowledge of Tableau for visualization. Here's a sample of my quant research, looking at the impact of Airbnb on local labour markets in the hotel industry in Germany: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874861

#### Project management
I developed my PM skills within non-profits, contributing to projects from inception and fundraising to final delivery. In my view, regular team meetings and constant monitoring and evaluation both internally and with stakeholders are key to successful delivery. As a PM, I lead teams of up to 10 people, I managed relationships with international donors and partners and kept things within the budget. 

#### Training and facilitating
I co-designed training courses and workshops to help build capacity for non-profits. Topics: project management, fundraising, community organizing, EU funds accession. 

#### Partnership building
Working in networks of NGOs meant that I had to identify and recruit new members, maintain relations with the existing ones and constantly improve the services delivered to them, find new partnerships and alliances. 

#### Strategic Development
For both NACAB (National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux) and ENNA (European Network of National Civil Society Associations), I identified industry trends and developed projects that moved the organizations forward. For example, within NACAB, I developed a new department based on trending methodollogies, I co-developed 7 community social businesses and got them funded.
