My passion for code started with a data science project in R, some Code academy tutorials, some Code Wars katas, and culminated with a super-intensive bootcamp, Makers Academy! I am a full stack junior web dev, trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming, with XP values at the core. I am at my best in Ruby, I started feeling friendly with JavaScript and I am equipped with universal learning-to-code skills. 

My professional background is in the field of civic enagement, policy and advocacy. I enjoyed my positions in non-profits, as I got to fulfill many roles, being at the same time researcher, data analyst, PR,  trainer and negotiator dealing with politicians and press. In my 8 years of experience, I started social businesses, trained community organizers, campaigned for social change. 

My dream developer job is within an agency or department working on innovating and digitalzing processes for clients, a place where we value impact, inclusiveness and sustainable growth.

## Skills

#### Project management
I developed my PM skills within non-profits, contributing to projects from inception and fundraising to final delivery. In my view, regular team meetings and constant monitoring and evaluation both internally and with stakeholders are key to successul delivery. As a PM, I lead teams of up to 10 people, I managed relationships with international donors and partners, I kept things within the budget and dealt with bureaucracy. 

#### Data analytics & reporting
This is by far the most useful skill in any job I held so far. It helped me deliver actionable research and document startegy.
My quantitative skills are in R, SPSS and STATA, with intermediate knowledge of Tableau for visualization.
Here's a sample of my quant research, looking at the impact of Airbnb on local labour markets in the hotel industry in Germany: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874861

#### Training and facilitating
I co-designed training courses and workshops to help build capacity for non-profits. Topics: project management, fundrasing, community organizing, EU funds accession. 

#### Networking
Working in networks of NGOs meant that I had to identify and recruit new members, maintain relations with the existing ones and constantly improve the services delivered to them, find new partnerships and alliances. Look at members as clients and you get a business skill out of it.   

#### Strategic Development
For both NACAB and ENNA, I identified industry trends and developed projects that moved the organizations forward. For example, within NACAB, I developed a new department based on trending methodollogies, I co-developed 7 community social businesses and got them funded.
