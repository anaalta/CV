My passion for code started with a data science project in R, some Code academy tutorials, some Code Wars katas, and culminated with a super-intensive bootcamp, Makers Academy! I am a full stack sfotware developr, trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming, with XP values at the core. 

Since July 2017, I work in Adtech, at Adventori, where we make software that personalizes advertising based on client data. While maintianing the MVC framework and an object-oriented mindset, this role thougt me a lot, from new programming languages - Groovy, Java with the Grails framework - to the benefits of good extensive testing in the context of weekly deployment in production, to the advantages of decentralized databases(Cassandra). 

My professional background is in the field of civic engagement, policy and advocacy. I enjoyed my positions in non-profits, as I got to fulfill many roles, being at the same time researcher, data analyst, PR, trainer and negotiator dealing with politicians and press. In my 8 years of experience, I started social businesses, trained community organizers, campaigned for social change. 

My dream developer job is within a company or department working on innovating and digitalizing processes for clients, a place where we value impact, inclusiveness and sustainable growth.

#### Project management
I developed my PM skills within non-profits, contributing to projects from inception and fundraising to final delivery. In my view, regular team meetings and constant monitoring and evaluation both internally and with stakeholders are key to successul delivery. As a PM, I lead teams of up to 10 people, I managed relationships with international donors and partners and kept things within the budget. 

#### Training and facilitating
I co-designed training courses and workshops to help build capacity for non-profits. Topics: project management, fundrasing, community organizing, EU funds accession. 

#### Partnership building
Working in networks of NGOs meant that I had to identify and recruit new members, maintain relations with the existing ones and constantly improve the services delivered to them, find new partnerships and alliances. 

#### Strategic Development
For both NACAB (National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux) and ENNA (European Network of National Civil Society Associations), I identified industry trends and developed projects that moved the organizations forward. For example, within NACAB, I developed a new department based on trending methodollogies, I co-developed 7 community social businesses and got them funded.
